<h1>ankigarden: an Anki flashcard automation tool</h1> 

because language learning can be done *quicker* üèÉ

## Why this, Alex?

Hello! I have been spending much time learning languages in the past few months and this is a tool that strives to make that process a bit easier. There's some general information about the project [here](https://sbsbsb.sbs/ankigarden).

This relies on [DeepL](https://deepl.com) for text translations and [SoundOfText](https://soundoftext.com) for pronunciation audio generation (and a special thanks goes to [Flora Moon](https://soundoftext.com/#about) for the latter tool üíû); you need an account for the first; for SoundOfText, just try to be mindful of data use ‚Äî and in the future I'll try to think of a more robust solution, too.

## And what does it do?

For a better understanding of what I was trying to solve, it might be useful to check the [motivation](https://sbsbsb.sbs/old-anki-procedure) for the project. At the moment, it is a good tool to process some phrases/vocabulary, and it handles bidireccional input (so you can query in Danish and get English, and the other way around). 

(it also supports other language combinations, but I haven't put much effort (yet?) into making that more accessible, nor is it thoroughly tested)


## Is it finished?

Not by any chance! But a few friends have asked to use it ‚Äî and I could really use the feedback. So this is still a private repository, and lots of work shall still be done ‚Äî you can the roadmap yourself at [the log](https://sbsbsb.sbs/ankigarden-log) ‚Äî but for the time-being, I don't think there will be any major works on this (I need to actually __use__ the tool instead of just tinkering with it!).


## And how can I get this thing going?

Yep! Let's go.

- install the `requirements.txt` as usual, in, ideally, a Python virtual environment ([just do it the usual way](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments), or use something fancier like [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv) instead)

- Ensure you have Anki running on your machine; [AnkiConnnect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159) should be installed and running;

- Manually import the `sample-deck-ankigarden.apkg` into your machine. This will implicitly also import my `Basic (and reversed) with pronunciation` notetype, which, to start with, can be useful (but you can now, or later, modify your notetypes as you wish);

```
ANKI_CONNECT_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8765/"

AUDIOS_SOURCE_DIR = "./audios/"
AUDIOS_ANKI_DIR = "./anki_audios_dir/"
```

The `AUDIOS_SOURCE_DIR` is a temporary directory in which generated audio files are stored; upon flashcard creation, they are moved to `AUDIOS_ANKI_DIR` ‚Äî this latter is not arbitrary: [the official documentation](https://docs.ankiweb.net/files.html#file-locations) discloses the paths (which are different between Windows and Linux). For example, mine is at `~/.local/share/Anki2/alex/collection.media`, but then I created a symbolic link (similar to Windows' shortcuts) and mapped it to `anki_audios_dir`.

My `USE_CONFIG` for Danish, for example:

```
USE_CONFIGS = {
        "english-to-danish": {
            "deck": "alex-danish",
            "target_lang": "Danish",
            "source_lang": "English",
            "notetype": "Basic (and reversed) with pronunciation"
            }
}
```

Then...err...fool around! It __should__ work, but you know how to reach me for any questions or problems arising (and I'll try to fix them, too!).

Oh, and I almost forgot: for now, it runs as `python main.py`
